# The Fall of Recen Crest

TFRC is an adventure like novel of my own imagination. Taking inspiration from fantesy genres and popular games such as *Dungeons and Dragons* and *World of Warcraft* in it you follow the narrative in effort to reach the end of the story.

## Installation

The fall of Raven Crest can be accessed through [My GitHub](https://github.com/federalolive/Unit-1-Project.git) or through [Surge](https://plastic-hate.surge.sh).

## Features
*The fall Of Raven Crest features multiple ways of navigating through the narrative that I created, however there are some choices that are dead ends and will restart the story.

*Written in HTML/CSS/Javascript

*Dynamic player state that effects choices and outcomes

# Planned Future Release
Due to time constraints, as well other extenuating factors there were some features that I was not able to implement in this iteration of the program that will be added at a later time. These features include:
* Additional dialogue and User choices.
* Party System.
  * Allowing for AI generated companions or player controlled (likely to be much further down the road).
* Combat and Inventory systems.
* Class system.
  * Allow players to pick a "class" given them access to abilities both in and outside of combat that drive story and narrative.
* Sound effects/Music to provide queues and ambience.
* Fixes to animation.
  * Resetting div class on each button click to allow for scrolling text animation.
